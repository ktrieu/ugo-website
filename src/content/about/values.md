### Not-For-Cost Model

While many companies claim to be not-for-profit, UGO II is the world's first not-for-cost company. In the name of efficiency, we strive to avoid spending any money whatsoever on our business, and so far we have mostly succeeded.

### Our Product Is

Our company motto reminds us not to limit ourselves to any one product, or indeed, to having products at all. At UGO II, our product _is_, no follow-up required.

### Who Can Say For Sure?

In business, the only thing that never changes is change. Our core value of "who can say for sure?" reminds us that sometimes, as the fast-paced world of business morphs into new and exciting forms, the best answer is no answer.

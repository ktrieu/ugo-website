name: "Bee-shaped Epipens"
tagline: Works for bees (but not for peanuts).

Traditional epi-pens offer a generic experience, temporarily halting all forms of anaphylactic shock. However, UGO II customers expect a white-glove, curated experience. Enter our new, bee-shaped Epipens. Specially formulated to only work on bee-induced allergic reactions, and sculpted by an industrial designer to resemble a bee, for maximum symbolic value.

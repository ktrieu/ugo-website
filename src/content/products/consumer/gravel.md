We were all saddened by the tragic attacks in New York on 9/11. UGO II is showing its support for America by releasing Freedom Tower Gravel. Every day, UGO II will lift three tons of rocks to the eighty-fifth floor of the Freedom Tower, crush it into gravel, and ship it back to the ground to be used in construction across America. Together, we can show the terrorists American strength.

UGO II pioneered outsourcing, leading to a massive decrease in labor costs. (Other effects on business have yet to be determined.) Now, UGO II brings outsourcing to the foodservice industry with its new line of hotdogs. Production will be outsourced to Costco, a long time UGO II partner, while UGO II handles proper pricing and profit collection.

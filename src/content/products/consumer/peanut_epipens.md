title: Peanut-shaped Epipens
tagline: Works for peanuts (But not for bees).

Traditional epi-pens offer a generic experience, temporarily halting all forms of anaphylactic shock. However, UGO II customers expect a white-glove, curated experience. Enter our new, peanut-shaped Epipens. Specially formulated to only work on peanut-induced allergic reactions, and sculpted by an industrial designer to resemble a peanut, for maximum symbolic value.

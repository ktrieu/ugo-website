It's a common complaint: Stricter post-9/11 TSA regulations make it harder and harder to bring snacks aboard a flight. Never fear, UGO II has invented the pho suitcase: a specially designed watertight piece of luggage that can hold 20 liters of pho. What's more: it's fully TSA approved. (When pho is used, alternate soups have not received TSA approval.)

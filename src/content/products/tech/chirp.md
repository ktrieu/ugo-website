An offshoot of UGO II's music streaming research, the Chirp™ Death Ray uses concentrated sound to kill at long range by vibrating the atoms in the target's skull out of alignment with the skeleton. A satellite-based version due for launch soon could theoretically kill any person in the Western Hemisphere. As an added feature, the Chirp™ Death Ray also transfers nineteen bytes per second at low power, allowing coupon distribution directly into the minds of consumers all over North America.

At UGO II, we firmly believe in freedom of speech, which is why we're so disappointed that American society continues to frown upon those who distribute the Unabomber manifesto. UGO II has pledged to defeat censorship by custom engraving the Unabomber's immortal words onto AirPods and distributing them, one pair at a time.

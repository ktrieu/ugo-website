At UGO II, we often face difficult decisions. To make them, we look to the example of [California Proposition 23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_California_Proposition_23), where Californians banded together to decisively legalize dialysis. At UGO II, we now put every minute decision to a full vote of our employees. Contact UGO II Sales to see how your business could adopt this model.

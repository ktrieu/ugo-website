Standard personality tests are too complex, leading to poor completion rates and results that can't be interpreted. UGO II's patented "Would You Rather" system condenses an individual's personality into simple binary choices. These tests also have additional benefits. Our line of glaucoma-themed Would You Rathers have made great contributions to our efforts to cure this multi-faceted disease.

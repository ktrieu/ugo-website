title: Slack Intern
---

At UGO II communication is a part of life. Nearly every employee at UGO is capable of talking with the people they work with. But, what if the employee you want to speak to is far away, or so ugly you can't be in the same room as them?

That's where you come in. As our Slack Intern, you will replicate the functionality of the popular messaging application Slack. This will include delivering messages, sending notifications, and transferring files. Applicants must have a good memory, walk quickly, and be able to make the Slack notification noise with no external aids.

Compensation: similar to Slack Pro pricing ($6.67 USD/mo).
